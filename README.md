# Course about Docker, Kubernetes and CI/CD.

## Description and use-case

As to keep learning, I enrolled in this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/) to improve my DevOps skills.


### Course

1. In the first part of the course, we started building a single application that was a web page using nodeJS. We used basic Docker commands to see containers, kill them and initial things like that. Then we created our first Dockerfile and made some port forwards and copied files into our container.
